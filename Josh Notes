working out dwell time in a parking lot
    from occupancy data averaged across time, work out on same day every week (one week cycle) or every fortnight (2 week cycle 
    working across pay fortnight?)
    also should account for school and public holidays,  a further extension would account for events and their impacts.
    
    
working out trip time (walking) use google transit?


working out trip time (disabled) ?  split distance between disabled parking bays.  a further extension would rate on accessability and is likely beyond our scope
